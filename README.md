#### Introduction

Built by ChickenMike, Ivy and MissileMann, Worromot is the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim experience that asks, “What if Todd had no rules?” This modlist is a chaotic love letter to memes, mayhem, and moments that make you laugh so hard you accidentally FUS RO DAH your keyboard. 

If you're curious about the specific mods in the list, the full modlist can be viewed [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/worromot-tamriel-gone-off-the-skooma-again).

### System Requirements

**DISCLAIMERS:**
- Worromot only supports English Steam versions of full Skyrim AE. GOG and other languages are not supported.
- HDD and external SSD installs are absolutely not supported.
- Any remote PC / desktop services or apps are not supported. (Including Steam Link)
- Only Windows 10/11 operating systems are supported. Windows LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant **WILL NOT WORK.**
- At least 8GB of GPU VRAM minimum is recommended for the list (1080p), otherwise you'll experience frequent stutters in exteriors. Higher resolutions may require even more.

## Installation

**⚠ WARNINGS ⚠:**
- **You must update Skyrim Special Edition to the latest version on Steam to install this list. DO NOT DOWNGRADE YOUR GAME TO INSTALL THIS LIST!**

### Pre-Installation

#### General Utilities
Preventing Major Meyhem

Before installing Worromot, please complete the following steps:<br/>
[**.NET 8.0 SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.404-windows-x64-installer)
.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. This is required for Synthesis and Scrambled Bugs to function properly.<br/>
[.NET 8.0 SDK (v8.0.404) - Windows x64 Installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.404-windows-x64-installer)<br/>

**Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022**
The Visual C++ Redistributable installs Microsoft C and C++ (MSVC) runtime libraries. These libraries are required by many applications built by using Microsoft C and C++ tools. This is required for Mod Organizer 2 and LOOT to function properly. Download both of them from:<br/>
[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 - x86](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)<br/>
[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 - x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)<br/>

#### Official Bethesda Content
Complete With Official Bethesda Bugs<br/>

**Steam Overlay**<br/>
The Steam Overlay is known to cause issues while playing Skyrim Special Edition, and you are advised to disable it; to do this perform the following:<br/>

    Load Steam.
    In the toolbar at the top of the window, click Steam.
    In the dropdown menu, click Settings.
    Then, in the pop-up box, select the In-Game menu item.
    Uncheck Enable the Steam overlay while in-game.

Alternatively, if you would just like to disable the Overlay for Skyrim Special Edition, you may:<br/>

    Load Steam.
    Click LIBRARY.
    In your games list, look for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition and right-click on it.
    In the dropdown menu, click Properties.
    Then, in the pop-up box, uncheck Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game.

Important: Do not install Skyrim in `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Program Files (x86)` — this can cause permission issues.
If it is already installed there, reinstall it to a different location to something like `C:\Games` works if you only have one drive, but if you have multiple, something like `D:\Modlist\` is preferred.<br/>
You can also use LostDragonist’s Steam Library Setup Tool to easily move or create a new library.<br/>

#### Antiviruses
Bad Antivirus...e<br/>

Remove or disable any 3rd party antiviruses such as `Webroot` or `Bitdefender`. These programs can cause issues with your installation due to how MO2's Virtual File Staging works.<br/>
You’ll also need to add the Wabbajack list folder to your antivirus exclusion list. Otherwise, the game may have trouble loading scripts, which can lead to crashes.<br/>

#### Few Other Small Tips
1. Set your Skyrim language to English: Right click on your Skyrim in Steam > Click `Properties` > Click the drop down box next to `Language` > Set the language to English<br/>
2. (Soft Requirement) A Nexus Premium account is recommended. Without Premium, you will need to manually click the `Slow Download` button for each mod.

#### Pagefile and Crash Prevention

Larger Skyrim modlists require a significant amount of memory and running out of memory **will** result in crashes and other potential issues. 

Due to Worromot's size and number of files required to be handled for the list, this step is **NOT** optional. **Regardless of how much RAM or VRAM you have, please do this step.**

 To set up your pagefile:

     1. Press **Win Key + R**
     2. Type *sysdm.cpl ,3* and hit **ENTER**
     3. Navigate to *Performance* and click the box "Settings..."
     3. Click the *Advanced* tab at the top
     4. Under *Virtual Memory* click the box "Change..."
     5. Uncheck *Automatically manage* if it is checked
     6. Select your disk drive, ideally your fastest solid state drive.
     7. Click the **Custom size:** button
     8. In the box next to **Initial Size (MB)** type `40960`
     9. In the box next to **Maximum Size (MB)** type `40960`
     10. Click the *Set* button
     11. Click *OK*
     12. Click *Apply*
     13. Click *OK*
     14. Restart your computer in order for your new pagefile to take effect.`
